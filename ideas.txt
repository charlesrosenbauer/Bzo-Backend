Having some way to have multiple views into a single data structure may be useful. For example:
Vec3 :: [ x F32; y F32; z F32
		| ds [3]F32
]

Where x,y,z and ds[i] are both equivalent ways of viewing this data structure.

Here's a way to do that with unions:

Vec3 :: (
	[ x F32; y F32; z F32 ],
	 ds [3]F32
)

However, we do want tagged unions. How do we do tagged unions?

One way would be:

Token :: (
	Tk_Int   [...]
	Tk_Flt   [...]
	Tk_Binop [...]
	...
)

Where, because these identifiers are capitalized and therefore are type ids, they are differentiated from standard fields.

Another way to do this would be:
Token :: (kind:
	Tk_Int   [...]
	Tk_Flt   [...]
	Tk_Binop [...]
	...
)

Where the "kind" variable is the tag.

However, what if we want to specify the values for the tags? Or the type of the tag?

Token :: (kind U16:
	0x00 : Tk_Int   [...]
	0x10 : Tk_Flt   [...]
	0x20 : Tk_Binop [...]
	...
)
