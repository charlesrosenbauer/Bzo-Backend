TODO:
* Fill out the rest of the parser
* Build out shortcut to bytecode gen and x86 gen via basic expressions
* Run valgrind, go through and fix off-by-one errors in the lexer. Doesn't look like many are left.

Expression parsing
* split expr lines on assignment
	* left  of assignment is comma-split and parsed as a retval list
	* right of assignment is placed in a specialized data structure
		* token list
		* wrapped values are parsed recursively to categorize (fncall, array ix, parentheses, lambda, etc.)
		* afterward, a recursive parseExpr function is passed over : px=((x:xs)->parse: x, [px: xs])
