TODO:
1. Get basic AST to produce primitive bytecode
	* Allow block inlining
	* Allow peepholes
	* Block hashing
	* Add Control flow stuff
2. Function pattern matching
	* Get function definition
	* Iterate through expressions
	* Create ordered pattern matching process
3. X86 Codegen
	* R/M Memory Addressing
	* SIB Memory Addressing
	* Refactor codegen - we should probably only handle a subset of x86 for sanity's sake
	* Naive Register allocation
	* Register allocation accounting for register specialization
