List memcpy appears to be inlined in most places, and explodes in terms of code use. Not sure how this performs. We'd probably have to switch to C++ and use templates to get around this problem.

Most calls to astStackPeek() appear to be inlined, with the internal branches amortized. This is probably a big performance improvement.

Perf stat suggests that the Bzo compiler at its current state (partial parser) is roughly on par with clang -O3. Branch mispredicts are rare, though biased toward Bzo (1.25 Bzo, 2.30 LLVM).
IPC is decent, though biased slightly toward LLVM (1.4 LLVM, 1.3 Bzo).
